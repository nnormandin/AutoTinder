## AutoTinder

AutoTinder is a python submodule used to put Tinder on autopilot. It extends the [pynder](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder) library of Tinder API calls written in python. The result is a set of convenience functions that allows you to easily automate and improve your experience.



## What can it do?

Tinder is great, but you shouldn't waste all day swiping when you can have someone else do it for you. AutoTinder chunks together the awesome basic functionality provided by `pynder` and lets you string together basic workflows with just a few lines of code.

* Initialize a Tinder session from the comfort of your computer
* Generate an authorization token if necessary
* Make yourself discoverable / undiscoverable
* Adjust your radius
* Change location (soon to be based on text search for location names)
* Like users around you (exclude those with mutual friends, if desired)

In addition to all of this great stuff, all of the functions and classes originally included in `pynder` remain intact. You can check them out [here](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder).

## What's next?

* Perform analysis of interactions with your matches
* Query matches by last time online and current distance from you
* Launch messages to recent matches based on user-defined criteria
* Send alerts with new matches and conversations
* Facial detection and scoring methods
* Delete stale / old conversations automatically
