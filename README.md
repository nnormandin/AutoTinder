## AutoTinder

AutoTinder is a python script used to put Tinder on autopilot. It uses the [pynder](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder) library of Tinder API calls written in python. 



## What can it do?

Tinder is great, but you shouldn't waste all day swiping when you can have someone else do it for you. AutoTinder chunks together the awesome basic functionality provided by `pynder` and lets you string together basic workflows with just a few lines of code.

* Initialize a Tinder session given a user's Facebook ID and autorization token
* Adjust radius
* Change location
* Like all users with no mutual friends in the local area
* Make profile discoverable / undiscoverable


## What's next?

* Launch messages to recent matches based on user-defined criteria
* Send alerts with new matches and conversations
* Facial detection and scoring methods
* Delete stale / old conversations automatically
